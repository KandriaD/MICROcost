# MICROcost
Calculating the cost of each experiement for the different Micro Lab courses to see where we can reduce costs.

Maybe I will also be able to use this to make the prepsheets for the courses: one for bacteria, and one for supplies 
(i.e. 2 for each course)
    to do this need a way to save/store each experiment and discard drafts/trials
    
BEFORE USE:
    Check and edit courseinfo.py to ensure it is up-to-date with current course enrollment
